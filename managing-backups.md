## Creating a backup on demand

## Downloading a backup

To download a backup, navigate to the *Manage* page of your service dashboard and click *Download* in the corresponding row for the backup you wish to download.

{{site.data.keyword.composeForScyllaDB}} backups are taken using the nodetool snapshot utility, backing up all the on-disk data files stored in the data directory. The snapshot can run while your databases are on-line. Incremental backups are not enabled on {{site.data.keyword.composeForScyllaDB}} deployments.
